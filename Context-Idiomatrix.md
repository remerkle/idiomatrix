# Idiomatrix — Project Reference

## What is this?

Idiomatrix is a language-learning web app (inspired by Duolingo) where users can learn **4 languages** (Dutch, Spanish, English, German) through spaced-repetition flashcards, an article checker (with a de/het-style quiz mode), a synonym lookup, a verb tenses reference, and a prepositions fill-in-the-blank quiz — all backed by curated dictionaries with a live Wiktionary fallback for words outside them. Built with React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS v4.

## Pages & Routes

| Route | Page | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `/` | HomePage | Just the language picker — picking a language navigates to `/learn` |
| `/learn` | LearnPage | Per-language menu of 5 learning sections (Flashcards/Articles/Synonyms/Verbs/Prepositions), plus a 6th "Pronominal Adverbs" card when Dutch is selected (Dashboard excluded, it's in the header); navigating here always sets `selectedLanguage` first (from Home or Dashboard) |
| `/dashboard` | DashboardPage | Streak, Total XP, Daily XP, daily goal, "Continue Learning" language picker (→ `/learn`) |
| `/flashcards` | FlashcardsPage | 5-card grid pulled randomly from the combined dictionary pool |
| `/articles` | ArticlesPage | Type a noun to look up its correct article; gender color-coded |
| `/synonyms` | SynonymsPage | Type a word to look up synonyms |
| `/verbs` | VerbTensesPage | Browse 100 common verbs per language; expand a tense card or the "All Tenses" table; search bar resolves a verb typed in any of the 4 languages to its equivalent in the selected language |
| `/prepositions` | PrepositionsPage | Fill-in-the-blank preposition quiz, 3 options per question |
| `/pronominal-adverbs` | PronominalAdverbsPage | Dutch-only: pick a pronominal adverb (er/hier/daar/waar), then a preposition, then fill in the split `<adverb> ... <preposition>` construction; shows a "Dutch only" guard if reached while another language is selected |

Lessons and Quiz pages/routes/data existed in the original scaffold and were removed (unused placeholders) — see git history if that flow needs reviving.

## Design System

Redesigned to an Anthropic.com-inspired editorial look (warm neutrals, serif headlines, muted pastel accents), replacing the original bright "Duolingo" visual language. All gamification (streak 🔥, XP ⚡, quiz scoring, flip-card flashcards) is unchanged — this was a pure visual/styling pass.

### Fonts
- **Source Serif 4** (Google Fonts, weights 400/600/700) — headlines and display numbers, applied via the `font-serif` utility (Tailwind v4 auto-generates it from the `--font-family-serif` theme token). Used at `font-semibold`, not `font-black` — editorial, not shouty.
- **Inter** (Google Fonts, weights 400/500/600/700/800) — body copy, nav, buttons, badges, labels; this is the default `font-sans`/body font.

### Color Palette

| Token | Hex | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| `--color-cream` | `#F7F4EE` | page/header background |
| `--color-surface` | `#FFFFFF` | card background |
| `--color-surface-tint` | `#F1EDE4` | hover states |
| `--color-border` | `#E3DFD4` | card/divider borders |
| `--color-ink` | `#1B1A17` | primary text/headings |
| `--color-muted` | `#6B6860` | secondary text/labels |
| `--color-accent` / `-dark` / `-light` | `#D97757` / `#B85C3E` / `#F3E2D9` | primary CTA, XP display |
| `--color-success` / `-dark` / `-light` | `#7A8F6E` / `#5F7256` / `#E3E8DC` | correct answers |
| `--color-error` / `-dark` / `-light` | `#B85C4F` / `#954A40` / `#F1DEDA` | wrong answers |
| `--color-nl` / `-light` | `#7C93B0` / `#E4EAF0` | Dutch accent (dusty blue) |
| `--color-es` / `-light` | `#D3A15C` / `#F3E7D3` | Spanish accent (ochre) |
| `--color-en` / `-light` | `#8FA37E` / `#E5EBDF` | English accent (sage) |
| `--color-de` / `-light` | `#BC7F6D` / `#F0E0DA` | German accent (muted clay) |
| `--color-feature` / `-light` | `#9B8AA8` / `#EAE3EC` | cross-cutting accent — Flashcards, Dutch neuter/`het`, "All Tenses" |

Each language keeps its original hue family (nl=blue, es=orange, en=green, de=red), just desaturated/warmed — defined once in `LANGUAGES` (`src/data/languages.ts`) and cascaded everywhere via the `color` field. Tokens live in `src/index.css` under `@theme { }` and are usable as Tailwind utilities (e.g. `bg-accent`); most components reference the raw hex directly via arbitrary-value classes (`text-[#1B1A17]`) rather than the token name, matching the pre-existing codebase convention.

### Visual Style
- **Cards**: flat `bg-white border border-[#E3DFD4]`, `rounded-2xl` — no 3D lift effect. The `accent` prop renders as a `border-l-4` stripe; a `tinted` card renders as a solid accent-colored block with no border (currently unused — was for hero/feature tiles before those were removed from the home page)
- **Buttons**: `rounded-full` pills, no border-b-4 press effect — `primary` = solid ink, `secondary` = ink-outlined, `danger` = solid error-color
- **Language/mode tabs**: `rounded-full` pill buttons across all pages (Articles, Synonyms, Verbs, Prepositions), replacing the old rectangular `rounded-xl` tabs; the header's nav links use the same solid-pill treatment (active = solid ink `bg-[#1B1A17]`, inactive = white bg + border)
- **Headings**: `font-serif font-semibold tracking-tight` in place of `font-black` Nunito
- **No hand-drawn illustration accents** — visual identity comes from type/color/shape alone (a deliberate scope decision, not an oversight)

### Mobile Responsiveness
- **Header** (`src/components/layout/Header.tsx`): logo and streak/XP are `shrink-0` (pinned); the 6-link nav is the only flexible piece, wrapped in a `relative min-w-0` container so it can shrink and scroll independently instead of forcing the whole page wider than the viewport
- Nav scrolling uses `overflow-x-auto` with the scrollbar hidden (`[scrollbar-width:none] [&::-webkit-scrollbar]:hidden`); scroll-affordance fade gradients render on whichever edge(s) still have off-screen content, tracked via `scrollLeft`/`scrollWidth` on scroll and resize. 6 pill buttons + logo + streak/XP genuinely don't fit at ~390px even with tightened gaps, so this scroll-fade is load-bearing, not optional polish — verified by scrolling the nav fully and confirming a far-right link (e.g. Prepositions) is still reachable and clickable
- `html, body { overflow-x: hidden }` in `src/index.css` remains as a general safety net against any element forcing page-wide horizontal scroll, independent of the header
- Text sizes/padding/gaps in the header step up at the `sm:` breakpoint (e.g. `text-xs sm:text-sm`, `px-2 sm:px-4`) to stay usable on narrow phones
- Grids that need to stack on narrow phones (e.g. the old home-page feature cards) use `grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-N` rather than a fixed column count — a real bug was hit here: a fixed `grid-cols-3` squeezed columns so narrow that wrapped text overflowed its card's colored background on a ~390px viewport

## Languages

Defined in `src/data/languages.ts`.

| ID | Name | Flag | Color |
|----|------|------|-------|
| `nl` | Dutch   | 🇳🇱 | Dusty blue `#7C93B0` |
| `es` | Spanish | 🇪🇸 | Ochre `#D3A15C` |
| `en` | English | 🇬🇧 | Sage `#8FA37E` |
| `de` | German  | 🇩🇪 | Muted clay `#BC7F6D` |

---

## Global State (AppContext)

`AppContext` holds:
- `progress: UserProgress` — streak, xp, level, dailyGoal, todayXp
- `selectedLanguage: Language` — the active language tab across all pages
- `setSelectedLanguage(lang)` — switch active language
- `addXp(amount)` — increment xp + todayXp

State is in-memory only (resets on refresh). Persistence (localStorage or backend) is not yet implemented.

---

## Navigation & the Learn Menu

- **Home (`/`)** shows only the "Choose your language" grid (4 cards from `LANGUAGES`). Clicking one calls `setSelectedLanguage(lang)` then navigates to `/learn`.
- **Learn (`/learn`, `src/pages/LearnPage.tsx`)** shows the selected language's flag/name and a `SECTIONS` grid (defined inline in the file) linking to Flashcards, Articles, Synonyms, Verbs, and Prepositions — each card tinted with `selectedLanguage.color`. When `selectedLanguage.id === 'nl'`, a 6th card (`PRONOMINAL_SECTION`) for Pronominal Adverbs is appended. Dashboard is deliberately excluded from this list since it's reachable from the header on every page.
- **Dashboard (`/dashboard`)** has its own "Continue Learning" grid — the same 4 language cards as Home — so a learner already on Dashboard can jump straight back into `/learn` for whichever language, without detouring through Home.
- **Header** (`src/components/layout/Header.tsx`) shows all 6 routes as pill buttons (Dashboard/Flashcards/Articles/Synonyms/Verbs/Prepositions) next to the "Idiomatrix" logo — this is the *current* state after an earlier simplification (down to just a Dashboard link) was reverted per explicit request; the header's nav is deliberately language-agnostic and always shows the same 6 links regardless of `selectedLanguage`. Pronominal Adverbs is intentionally **not** in the header (it's Dutch-only, so it only ever appears in the Learn menu, conditionally).

Both the Learn menu and the header have gone through multiple redesign iterations this project's history — if a screenshot or memory references a different header/home-page layout, trust the current code over that snapshot.

## Wiktionary Integration

All three dictionary-backed features share `src/utils/wiktionary.ts`, whose `fetchWiktionaryWikitext(word)` hits the English Wiktionary API (`en.wiktionary.org/w/api.php?action=query&...`) and returns the raw wikitext for a page, or `null` on a missing page/network error/timeout (6s `AbortController`). Each feature has its own parser on top of that shared fetch:

| Util | Used by | Extracts |
|------|---------|----------|
| `dutchGender.ts` → `lookupDutchArticle()` | Articles (Dutch only) | `{{nl-noun\|X}}` template → `de`/`het` |
| `wiktionarySynonyms.ts` → `lookupWiktionarySynonyms()` | Synonyms (all 4 languages) | Inline `{{syn\|xx\|...}}` template (first sense found), falling back to an older-style `===Synonyms===` section |
| `wiktionaryTranslation.ts` → `lookupWiktionaryTranslation()` | Flashcards "add a word" (all 4 languages) | First numbered definition line (`# ...`) under the word's language section, cleaned of wikitext markup |

Common pattern across all three:
- Isolate the correct language section first (`==Dutch==`, `==Spanish==`, etc.) so results aren't cross-contaminated between languages sharing a page
- 400ms debounce before firing the lookup from the UI
- Results cached permanently in `localStorage` (`idiomatrix-dutch-gender`, `idiomatrix-wiktionary-synonyms`, `idiomatrix-wiktionary-translations`), including a cached "not found" sentinel so repeat misses don't re-hit the API
- Known limitation: parsing is page-level, not sense-level, so a word with multiple parts of speech can occasionally surface synonyms/glosses for the wrong sense (e.g. German "schnell" the adverb vs. adjective) when the primary sense lacks inline data

---

## Article Checker (`/articles`)

**File:** `src/pages/ArticlesPage.tsx`
**Data:** `src/data/nounArticles.ts` → exported as `NOUN_ARTICLES: NounArticle[]`

### NounArticle type (`src/types/index.ts`)
```ts
export type NounArticle = {
  id: string;
  languageId: string;
  noun: string;
  article: string;
  gender: 'masculine' | 'feminine' | 'neuter' | 'common' | 'indefinite';
  translation: string;
};
```

### Dictionary sizes
| Language | Count | Format |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Dutch (`nl`) | ~1000 nouns | Compact `makeEntries()` tuples |
| Spanish (`es`) | 25 nouns | Plain object array |
| English (`en`) | 20 nouns | Plain object array |
| German (`de`) | 25 nouns | Plain object array |

### `makeEntries()` helper
Both `nounArticles.ts` and `synonyms.ts` use a compact tuple format to avoid repetitive object boilerplate:
```ts
type Entry = readonly [string, string, NounArticle['gender'], string];
// makeEntries(languageId, idPrefix, entries) → NounArticle[]
const DUTCH_NOUNS = makeEntries('nl', 'nl', [
  ['hond', 'de', 'common', 'dog'],
  ['kind', 'het', 'neuter', 'child'],
  // ...~1000 entries
]);
```

### Gender color-coding
| Gender | Color | Used for |
|--------|-------|---------|
| `common` | Dusty blue `#7C93B0` | Dutch `de` words |
| `neuter` | Muted mauve `#9B8AA8` (`--color-feature`) | Dutch `het` words |
| `masculine` | Dusty blue `#7C93B0` | Spanish/German masculine |
| `feminine` | Muted clay `#BC7F6D` | Spanish/German feminine |
| `indefinite` | Success green `#5F7256` | English `a`/`an` |

### UI behavior
- **Curated match** (word in `NOUN_ARTICLES`): shows article + translation + gender badge instantly, no API call
- **Wiktionary match** (Dutch only, word not in curated list): shows article + gender badge + "via Wiktionary" note; lookup fires after 400ms debounce
- **Loading state**: "Looking up…" pulse shown while Wiktionary call is in flight (Dutch only)
- **Not found**: "check the spelling?" for Dutch (Wiktionary exhausted); "not in our dictionary yet" for other languages
- **Prefix suggestions**: up to 5 clickable matches from curated list while typing
- **Browse all**: full grid of all curated nouns for the selected language when input is empty
- **Language tabs**: synced with global `selectedLanguage` from AppContext; clears input on switch; Wiktionary lookup only runs for Dutch

### Article Quiz mode
**File:** `src/components/articles/ArticleQuiz.tsx`

A "Look up" / "📝 _articles_ Quiz" mode toggle appears on the Articles page for all 4 languages. The quiz question always asks "Which article?" and offers the buttons appropriate to the selected language, defined in the exported `QUIZ_ARTICLES` map:

| Language | Article choices |
|----------|-----------------|
| Dutch (`nl`) | de / het |
| Spanish (`es`) | el / la |
| English (`en`) | a / an |
| German (`de`) | der / die / das |

- Draws 10 random nouns (`QUIZ_SIZE`) from the selected language's slice of `NOUN_ARTICLES` via Fisher-Yates shuffle, one question at a time (not a grid like Flashcards); re-draws automatically whenever the selected language changes
- The correct answer is checked against each entry's `article` field (not `gender`) — this matters for exceptions like Spanish "agua" (`el`, feminine)
- Answer buttons render in a 2- or 3-column grid depending on how many choices the language has (German's 3 vs. everyone else's 2)
- Learner picks an article; the choice locks in immediately (buttons disable), correct answer highlights in the success color, a wrong pick highlights in the error color while the correct one still shows success, and the noun's translation is revealed
- Correct answers award **+5 XP** (`XP_PER_CORRECT`) via `addXp`, matching the Flashcards reward per card
- A `ProgressBar` tracks question 1–10; an explicit "Next question" / "See results" button advances (no auto-timer)
- End screen shows score out of 10, a percentage badge (color scales with performance), and "Play again" to redraw a fresh random 10
- Reads `selectedLanguage` and `addXp` from `AppContext` directly (no props), so it stays in sync with the language tabs on the page

---

## Synonyms (`/synonyms`)

**File:** `src/pages/SynonymsPage.tsx`
**Data:** `src/data/synonyms.ts` → exported as `SYNONYMS: Synonym[]`

### Synonym type (`src/types/index.ts`)
```ts
export type Synonym = {
  id: string;
  languageId: string;
  word: string;
  synonyms: string[];
  translation: string;
};
```

25 curated words per language (adjectives, verbs, common vocabulary), each with 2-4 synonyms and a translation. Same UX pattern as Articles: curated match shows instantly with clickable synonym chips (clicking one re-searches for it); words outside the curated list fall back to a debounced Wiktionary lookup via `lookupWiktionarySynonyms()`, shown with a "via Wiktionary · no translation in our dictionary" note since Wiktionary doesn't give us a translation, only synonyms. Works for all 4 languages (unlike the Dutch-only gender fallback in Articles).

---

## Flashcards (`/flashcards`)

**File:** `src/pages/FlashcardsPage.tsx`

### Deck construction
`getFlashcardPool(languageId)` in `src/data/languages.ts` merges three sources into one deduped pool (by lowercased front text):
- Curated `FLASHCARDS[]` (a handful of hand-written cards, e.g. greetings)
- Every `NOUN_ARTICLES` entry for that language, front rendered as `${article} ${noun}` so article practice is baked in
- Every `SYNONYMS` entry for that language

This gives Dutch **1000+** flashcards and the other languages **~50** each, versus the original 2-3 hardcoded cards.

### Session behavior
- On mount / language switch, a fresh random sample of **5 cards** (`SESSION_SIZE`) is drawn via Fisher-Yates shuffle and shown together as a grid — not one at a time
- Each card flips independently on click; flipping a card for the first time immediately marks it reviewed (turns green, "Reviewed" badge, +5 XP) — there's no separate Easy/Good/Hard rating step
- Once all cards in the session are reviewed, a "New words" button draws a fresh random 5
- **Add a word**: a search box below the grid lets you type any word in the selected language; if it's not already in the session, a 400ms-debounced Wiktionary lookup (`lookupWiktionaryTranslation()`) fires and shows a preview card with an "Add" button that appends it to the current session (session-only, not persisted to the dictionary files)

---

## Verb Tenses (`/verbs`)

**File:** `src/pages/VerbTensesPage.tsx`
**Data:** `src/data/verbs/` → `VERBS: Verb[]` (100 per language × 4 languages = 400 total), plus `PERSON_LABELS` and `TENSE_LABELS` lookup tables, all re-exported from `src/data/verbs/index.ts`

### Verb type (`src/types/index.ts`)
```ts
export type TenseKey = 'present' | 'past' | 'future' | 'presentPerfect';
export type ConjugationSet = [string, string, string, string, string, string]; // fixed person order

export type Verb = {
  id: string;
  languageId: string;
  infinitive: string;
  translation: string;
  present: ConjugationSet;
  past: ConjugationSet;
  future: ConjugationSet;
  presentPerfect: ConjugationSet;
};
```

### Person order (shared across all 4 languages so tables line up)
`[1st sg, 2nd sg, 3rd sg, 1st pl, 2nd pl, 3rd pl]` — e.g. English: I / you / he-she-it / we / you-all / they. Actual pronoun labels per language live in `PERSON_LABELS` (`src/data/verbs/labels.ts`): Dutch `ik/jij/hij-zij-het/wij/jullie/zij`, Spanish `yo/tú/él-ella-usted/nosotros/vosotros/ellos-ellas`, German `ich/du/er-sie-es/wir/ihr/sie-Sie`.

### Tenses covered
Present, Past (simple past/preterite, not a continuous form), Future, and Present Perfect — the same 4-tense set across all languages, with language-specific grammar names in `TENSE_LABELS` (e.g. Dutch "Tegenwoordige tijd"/"Verleden tijd"/"Toekomende tijd"/"Voltooid tegenwoordige tijd"; German "Präsens"/"Präteritum"/"Futur I"/"Perfekt"; Spanish "Presente"/"Pretérito"/"Futuro"/"Pretérito perfecto"). Compound tenses (future, present perfect) use the grammatically correct auxiliary per verb — including the hebben/zijn (Dutch) and haben/sein (German) split for verbs of motion/change of state.

### UI behavior
- One verb "presented at a time": a navigator card shows the infinitive + translation with **Prev/Next** buttons and a "Verb N of 100" counter; switching languages resets to verb 1
- Below it, a vertical stack of tense cards (Present, Past, Future, Present Perfect) plus a 5th **"📋 All Tenses"** card
- Clicking a tense card expands a conjugation card directly beneath it, listing all 6 persons for that tense; multiple tense cards can be expanded at once (not an exclusive accordion)
- Clicking "All Tenses" expands a table below it instead — rows are the 4 tenses, columns are the 6 persons, so the whole conjugation is visible at a glance; the table's card wrapper scrolls horizontally on narrow viewports (German's 6-person columns are the widest case)
- Expansion state resets whenever the verb or language changes
- A collapsed **"Browse all 100 verbs"** grid at the bottom lets you jump directly to any verb (highights the currently-selected one) instead of paging through with Prev/Next
- No XP awarded — this is a reference/study tool like Articles' lookup mode, not a scored exercise

### Cross-language search
**File:** `src/utils/verbSearch.ts`, wired up in `VerbTensesPage.tsx`

A search input above the verb navigator lets a learner type a verb in *any* of the 4 languages and jump to its equivalent in whichever language is currently selected (e.g. typing Spanish "ser" or English "be" while browsing Dutch lands on "zijn").

- `findVerbSuggestions(query)` returns up to 5 matches across all 400 `VERBS` entries (any language), ranked: exact infinitive match → infinitive prefix match → exact translation-token match → translation-token prefix match. This ranking matters: a naive single-tier `startsWith` match on the raw `translation` string lets short queries get swamped by unrelated verbs (typing "be" without ranking surfaces Dutch "kunnen" — translation "to be able to / can" — ahead of the actual English "be" entry, since "be able to" also starts with "be"). Translations are split on `/`, `,`, `;` into individual sense-tokens before matching so multi-sense glosses like "must / to have to" match on "must" specifically, not just as a prefix of the whole joined phrase.
- `findEquivalentVerb(hit, targetLanguageId)` resolves a clicked suggestion to the target language via a `glossKey`: for English entries this is the (already-English) infinitive itself; for nl/es/de it's the first translation token, normalized. This split exists because English verbs' `translation` field is a **definitional gloss**, not a "to X" translation (see caveat below) — using the infinitive sidesteps that inconsistency entirely rather than trying to reconcile the two formats.
- Diacritic-insensitive (`stripDiacritics` via `String.prototype.normalize('NFD')`) so plain-ASCII typing matches accented infinitives (Spanish "oír", German "läuft").
- Not every verb has a cross-language equivalent — the 4 "100 most common verbs" lists were curated independently per language and don't fully overlap. When `findEquivalentVerb` returns `null`, a small Card renders `No {language} equivalent found for "{word}" ({flag} {gloss})` instead of failing silently or erroring.
- One-to-many gloss collisions (e.g. Spanish "ser" and "estar" both gloss to "be") resolve deterministically to whichever appears first in `VERBS` — not treated as an error case.

### Content provenance & known caveats
The 400 verb entries (100 × 4 languages) were authored by dedicated research passes per language, cross-checking irregular high-frequency verbs (modals, "to be"/"to have"-type verbs, strong/irregular preterites) by hand. A few noted edge cases if inaccuracies surface during use:
- Dutch `zullen` ("shall/will") doesn't have a natural future or present-perfect in real usage; those two tenses were constructed grammatically for schema consistency rather than reflecting attested usage.
- Dutch aux choice (hebben vs. zijn) for a handful of verbs with regional/contextual variation (lopen, rijden, vliegen, zwemmen, beginnen, eindigen, vergeten, veranderen) reflects the more common reading — native usage sometimes splits by transitive vs. directional sense.
- German aux choice for stehen/liegen/sitzen uses standard High German (`haben`); Southern German/Austrian usage prefers `sein`.
- Spanish `levantarse`/`casarse` are reflexive, so their conjugated forms include the clitic pronoun (`me levanto`, `se casó`) rather than a bare stem.
- English `get`'s present perfect uses the American "gotten" rather than British "got"; `learn`/`learned` likewise uses the American form over "learnt".
- English verbs' `translation` field is a **definitional gloss**, not an English-to-English "translation" — e.g. "have" → "possess / own", "go" → "move toward a place" — since translating English to English would just repeat the word. This is intentional (adds learner value a redundant "to have" wouldn't), but it means the English verb list's `translation` field is *not* directly comparable to the nl/es/de lists' "to X" translations; the cross-language search (above) works around this by keying English entries on their own infinitive instead.

## Prepositions (`/prepositions`)

**File:** `src/pages/PrepositionsPage.tsx` + `src/components/prepositions/PrepositionQuiz.tsx`
**Data:** `src/data/prepositions/` → `PREPOSITION_EXERCISES: PrepositionExercise[]` (120 per language × 4 languages = 480 total), split into one file per language (`dutchPrepositions.ts`, etc.) sharing a `makeEntries()` helper + `Entry` tuple type from `shared.ts`, combined in `index.ts`

### PrepositionExercise type (`src/types/index.ts`)
```ts
export type PrepositionExercise = {
  id: string;
  languageId: string;
  sentence: string; // contains "___" marking the blank
  correct: string;
  distractors: [string, string];
  translation: string;
};
```

### Distractor design
Each exercise's 2 wrong options aren't random prepositions — they're specifically the ones a non-native speaker is likely to mistakenly pick, generally because:
- **Literal translation from the learner's other languages fails** — e.g. Dutch "in het weekend" (not "op"), because English says "on the weekend"; German "Angst vor" (not "von"/"an"), because English says "afraid of"
- **Fixed verb/adjective + preposition pairings** that don't map 1:1 across languages — e.g. Spanish "pensar en" vs. "pensar a", German "sich freuen auf" (upcoming) vs. "sich freuen über" (already happened) vs. "an"
- **Near-synonym prepositions with a real grammatical distinction** — e.g. English "between" (exactly two) vs. "among"/"amongst" (three+); Spanish "por" vs. "para" (reason/means vs. purpose/destination); German locational in/an/auf (enclosed space vs. vertical surface vs. horizontal surface)

The `translation` field doubles as the answer explanation — for non-English languages it's an English translation of the sentence plus a short rule; for English exercises (already in English) it's just the usage rule.

### UI behavior (mirrors `ArticleQuiz`'s architecture)
- Draws 10 random exercises (`QUIZ_SIZE`) per session via Fisher-Yates shuffle from the selected language's pool; re-draws when the language tab changes
- The 3 options (correct + 2 distractors) are re-shuffled per question so the correct answer isn't always in the same position
- The blank renders inline in the sentence (underscored placeholder before answering, filled with the learner's pick and colored success/error after)
- Selecting locks in the choice, highlights correct/wrong in the success/error colors (with the correct one still highlighted), and reveals the translation/rule
- Correct answers award **+5 XP** (`XP_PER_CORRECT`), matching Flashcards and the Articles de/het quiz
- End screen shows score out of 10, a percentage badge, and "Play again" to redraw a fresh random 10
- No separate "look up" mode — this page is quiz-only, unlike Articles which offers both a lookup and a quiz mode

### Content scale
Each language started with 20 hand-written exercises, then a dedicated research pass per language added 100 more (120 total per language), explicitly covering different ground from the first 20 — additional fixed reflexive-verb/preposition idioms, extended time/location prepositions, and everyday-life scenarios — verified for zero duplicate sentences and exactly one unambiguous correct answer per entry.

## Pronominal Adverbs & Prepositions (`/pronominal-adverbs`, Dutch only)

**Files:** `src/pages/PronominalAdverbsPage.tsx` + `src/components/pronominal/PronominalAdverbExercise.tsx`
**Data:** `src/data/pronominalAdverbs.ts` → `ADVERBS`, `PREPOSITIONS`, `PRONOMINAL_ADVERB_EXERCISES: PronominalAdverbExercise[]` (48, generated) + `completeDutchSentence()` helper

The only Dutch-specific grammar feature in the app (every other feature works across all 4 languages). Covers Dutch's pronominal adverbs — `er` (unstressed "it/them"), `hier` ("this"), `daar` ("that"), and `waar` (interrogative "what/which") — each of which combines with a fixed preposition (eraan, hieraan, daaraan, waaraan, ...; ermee, hiermee, daarmee, waarmee; ...) and can split from that preposition elsewhere in the clause, e.g. "houden van" ("to like") → "Ik hou er veel van" ("I like it a lot"). This replaced an earlier version of the feature that only covered `er` combined with specific verbs (houden van, denken aan, etc.); the current version instead covers all 4 adverbs crossed with the 12 prepositions from the reference table the user supplied (aan, achter, bij, door, in, mee/met, naar, om, onder, op, over, tegen) — a full grammar-topic drill rather than a curated vocabulary list.

### PronominalAdverbExercise type (`src/types/index.ts`)
```ts
export type AdverbId = 'er' | 'hier' | 'daar' | 'waar';

export type PronominalAdverbExercise = {
  id: string;
  adverbId: AdverbId;
  prepositionId: string;      // e.g. "aan"
  prepositionLabel: string;   // e.g. "aan" or "mee / met"
  sentence: string;           // Dutch sentence with exactly two "___" blanks
  blank1: { correct: string; distractors: [string, string] }; // the adverb vs. two other adverbs
  blank2: { correct: string; distractors: [string, string] }; // the preposition vs. two other real prepositions
  guide: { en: string; es: string; de: string }; // guide sentence per non-Dutch language, shown upfront as a hint
};
```

Dutch guide text is **derived, not stored** — `completeDutchSentence(exercise)` fills the sentence's own two blanks with its own answer key, so there's no separate Dutch string that could drift out of sync with the answer key.

### Content design — generated, not hand-authored per entry
`src/data/pronominalAdverbs.ts` defines 12 `PrepFamily` objects (one per preposition), each with a **declarative** sentence template (shared by `er`/`hier`/`daar` — only which adverb is correct changes; the guide sentence disambiguates which one) and a **question** template (used for `waar`, since it's inherently interrogative and can't slot into a declarative clause the way the other three can). `PRONOMINAL_ADVERB_EXERCISES` is then `ADVERBS.flatMap(adverb => PREP_FAMILIES.map(family => ...))` — a 4×12 cross-product generated at module load, not 48 hand-written object literals. This is a deliberate departure from this repo's usual "flat array of curated entries" convention (see `Key Decisions & Conventions`), justified because the content genuinely factors into two regular, independent axes (adverb × preposition) rather than being a heterogeneous curated list.

`blank1` distractors are the other 2-3 adverbs (`ADVERB_DISTRACTORS`, e.g. correct=`er` → distractors `hier`/`daar`); `blank2` distractors are 2 other real prepositions from the same 12-item set (never an outside preposition), so wrong answers stay plausible Dutch, not nonsense. Guide sentences intentionally sometimes read identically for `er` and `daar` in German specifically (e.g. both → "Ich denke oft daran.") — German's own da-/wo- compound system doesn't distinguish "it" from "that" the way Dutch's er/daar split does, so forcing an artificial distinction there would be inaccurate.

### UI behavior
- Route guards on `selectedLanguage.id !== 'nl'`, rendering a "Dutch only" Card instead of the exercise — necessary because the route is reachable independent of the Learn menu's conditional card (direct URL, browser back/forward)
- Three-level navigation, all local `useState` on `PronominalAdverbsPage`: adverb menu (4 cards) → preposition menu (12 cards, matching the reference table) → `<PronominalAdverbExercise>`. No subtitle/intro paragraph under the page's `<h1>` — the guide sentence inside each exercise carries that explanatory weight instead
- Both blanks are independent 3-button multiple-choice rows (reuses `PrepositionQuiz`'s exact color states — green once correct, red once wrong-selected, muted once wrong-unselected); this keeps "fill in the blank" consistent with the rest of the app's established idiom of multiple-choice-into-a-blank rather than free-text input
- **+5 XP** (`XP_PER_CORRECT`), awarded once, only when both blanks are correct (not per-blank) — guarded by an `xpAwarded` flag so re-renders can't double-award
- The guide-sentence panel renders **at the top of the exercise, before either blank is answered** — it's meant to be used as a hint while attempting the blanks, not a reveal-after-answering confirmation (this was a deliberate change from the panel's original gated/reveal-after-both-blanks behavior). A 4-flag picker lets the learner choose which of the 4 app languages the guide displays in — defaults to `selectedLanguage.id !== 'nl' ? selectedLanguage.id : 'en'` (in practice always `'en'`, since the page-level guard means `selectedLanguage` is always Dutch here) — purely local component state, does not touch the global `selectedLanguage`/`setSelectedLanguage`

## Key Decisions & Conventions

- **Tailwind v4** is used via `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin — no `tailwind.config.js`, config lives in `@theme {}` in `index.css`
- **Named exports** for all components and pages (no default exports except `App`)
- **Dictionary data split**: `NOUN_ARTICLES` and `SYNONYMS` each live in their own file under `src/data/` (not `languages.ts`) to keep the main data file manageable; `languages.ts` re-exports both
- **Flashcards reuses other features' data** rather than maintaining its own large word list — `getFlashcardPool()` derives cards from `NOUN_ARTICLES` + `SYNONYMS`
- **Wiktionary fetch logic is shared** (`utils/wiktionary.ts`) across all three lookup features; only the wikitext-parsing logic differs per feature
- **No auth** — user is anonymous; progress is ephemeral for now
- **No backend** — all data is static until a backend is added

## Running the Project

```bash
npm run dev     # start dev server at http://localhost:5173
npm run build   # production build
npm run preview # preview production build
```

---

## Deployment

- **Hosting**: Vercel, free Hobby tier. Vercel project is named `idiomatrix` (previously `idiomatic`, previously `pentalingo`) — dashboard: `vercel.com/remerkle-9465s-projects/idiomatrix`. Live production URL is **`idiomatrix.vercel.app`** — the domain has been migrated to match the current app name, so this is safe to share/bookmark (e.g. for testing on a phone) without checking Settings → Domains first.
- **Source**: GitHub repo `remerkle/idiomatrix` (renamed from `remerkle/idiomatic`, which was itself renamed from `remerkle/pentalingo`, via `gh repo rename`; GitHub auto-redirects old URLs), connected to Vercel's Git integration
- **Auto-deploy**: every push to `main` triggers a production deployment automatically (no manual `vercel deploy` needed going forward)
- **Vercel project**: linked by project ID in `.vercel/project.json` (gitignored) — renaming the GitHub repo does not break this link since Vercel tracks it by ID, not name

### Naming history
The app has been renamed twice: **Pentalingo → Idiomatic → Idiomatrix**. Each rename followed the same process and hit the same recurring snag:
- **Done each time**: every in-code/doc reference (header logo, page title, `package.json`/lockfile name, localStorage cache key prefixes, this file's own name and content) and the GitHub repo rename via `gh repo rename`
- **Local folder — resolved**: the project's local folder on disk was stuck at `pentalingo` across both earlier rename rounds (Windows refused the rename with a "file in use" error while VS Code/Claude Code's extension host held an open handle on it as the active workspace root). This has since been fixed — the working directory is now `C:\Users\rolan\Documents\Claude\Code\idiomatrix`, matching the current app name.
- **Vercel project/domain**: renamed dashboard-side by the user each time (not something achievable via API in this session — no live Vercel API access). The actual live `*.vercel.app` domain lags behind the project-name rename unless a new domain is explicitly added under Settings → Domains, so don't assume the live URL matches the current app name without checking.
